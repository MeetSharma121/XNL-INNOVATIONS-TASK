#PHASE 5: TESTING, VALIDATION, AND CONTINUOUS
IMPROVEMENT
# AI Model Testing and Monitoring Framework

This framework provides comprehensive tools for testing, validating, and continuously improving AI models. It includes components for model evaluation, drift detection, continuous training, and custom test suites.

## Components

### 1. Model Evaluation (`model_evaluation/evaluator.py`)
- Comprehensive metrics calculation (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)
- NLP-specific metrics (BLEU, ROUGE scores)
- K-fold cross-validation support
- Edge case evaluation

### 2. Drift Detection (`monitoring/drift_detector.py`)
- Data drift detection using statistical tests
- Concept drift detection through performance monitoring
- Wasserstein distance calculation
- Historical drift tracking

### 3. Continuous Training (`monitoring/continuous_trainer.py`)
- Automated model retraining based on drift detection
- Performance threshold monitoring
- Model versioning and storage
- Training history tracking

### 4. Custom Test Suites (`test_suites/custom_test_suite.py`)
- Support for custom test cases
- Edge case testing
- Multi-turn conversation testing
- Test result storage and analysis

## Usage

### Model Evaluation
```python
from testing.model_evaluation.evaluator import ModelEvaluator

evaluator = ModelEvaluator(model, k_folds=5)
metrics = evaluator.perform_cross_validation(X, y)
nlp_metrics = evaluator.calculate_nlp_metrics(references, predictions)
```

### Drift Detection
```python
from testing.monitoring.drift_detector import DriftDetector

detector = DriftDetector(reference_data, window_size=1000)
drift_detected, metrics = detector.detect_data_drift(new_data)
```

### Continuous Training
```python
from testing.monitoring.continuous_trainer import ContinuousTrainer

trainer = ContinuousTrainer(model, drift_detector)
retrained, metrics = trainer.check_and_retrain(new_data, new_labels)
```

### Custom Test Suite
```python
from testing.test_suites.custom_test_suite import CustomTestSuite, TestCase

test_suite = CustomTestSuite(model, evaluator)
test_suite.add_edge_case(input_data, expected_output, "Test description")
results = test_suite.run_tests()
```

## Installation

1. Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Ensure NLTK data is downloaded:
```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**
   - Run the test suite regularly, especially after model updates
   - Monitor drift detection results continuously
   - Save and analyze test results over time

2. **Drift Management**
   - Set appropriate thresholds for drift detection
   - Regularly update reference data
   - Monitor retraining frequency

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Track metrics over time
   - Set up alerts for significant performance drops
   - Maintain comprehensive test coverage

4. **Data Management**
   - Keep test data separate from training data
   - Regularly update test cases
   - Document edge cases and their handling

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code structure
2. Add tests for new features
3. Update documentation as needed
4. Maintain type hints and docstrings
